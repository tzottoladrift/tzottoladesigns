repository for my portfolio site
TZottolaDesigns.com

HTML/CSS site with links to projects hosted on Dreamhost.

Employed CSS Grid for portfolio section.
Includes: short intro, portfolio section, links to social media, contact information, picture.

For my personal site, I chose a bold palette but used it sparingly to keep it from overwhelming the design. The original design had the pattern across the entire background. That proved to be too busy, so I moved it to the header and footer only, creating a cleaner look.
